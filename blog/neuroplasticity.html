      <h2 >Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <h3>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people? </h3>
      <p>
        By understanding the principles of neuroplasticity enables people to change their mindset about themselves and their abilities. Therefore, people are more likely to feel empowered to step out of their comfortable zone and embrace challenges. 
      </p>
      <h3>How you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit?</h3>
      <p>
        First, practice, practice, practice. This is especially true for coding. The more i practice coding, the more connections will be between my neurons and brain.  Also, believe I can do it can affect how will I do it, too. So I need to have confidence in myself.  Lastly, I will apply just in time learning so my learning can happen in a meaningful context, which will be more productive. 
      </p>
      <h3> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        Exercising, reading, practicing mindfulness, journaling , healthy eating, relating to others and more.

     <h2 >Growth Mindset</h2>
     <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
     <p>
      Growth mindset is one individual believes that his/her abilities can be developed through effort. It is opposite of fixed mindset, which believes one’s ability and talent is fixed. 
     </p>As doctor Dweck nicely put it:
     <p>
      The growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ in every which way in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments, everyone can change and grow through application and experience.

      It is relevant because learning web development is entering a new world for most of us at Dev Academy. I definitely do not have the skills yet, but do I believe I can develop those skills or not matters a lot! It will affect how I approach challenges every time there is a setback.
    </p>

    <h3> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p>
      I view myself have a growth mindset as I am constantly challenging myself! I believe in effort and practice. The new learning is “acceptance”, accepting failures is hard! When I cannot do something, sometimes I tend to dig too hard to find the solutions. I do not give up easily but in the learning journey at Dev Academy. I have learnt that sometimes it is ok to move on with minor problems or failures! 
    </p>
    <h3> How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
     <p>
      I will keep remind myself I haven’t achieved my goals yet, but I am growing my abilities every single day!

    <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
    <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</h3>
    <p>
      No matter what my abilities are at the moment, I need to keep practicing and seeing setbacks a good opportunity to develop my skills. My strategy will be actively identifying ma learning gaps and setbacks, using them a learning opportunity! Believe I can do it first, and then go reach out to find the solutions. My attitude matters.
