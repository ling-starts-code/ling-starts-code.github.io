    <h3>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
    <ul class="a">
      <li>
        what was the problem?
      </li>
      <li>
        what problem-solving techniques did you use?
      </li>
      <li>
        how did you feel throughout the process?
      </li>
      <li>
        what did you learn?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The problem was to solve the Super FizzBuzz kata! I could not get my head around the logic. I tried google first but I couldnâ€™t understand the specific part where I was stuck. I read some answers on stackoverflow and watched some youtube videos as well. I felt like I knew some bits and bobs, but i did not know how to put them together and make them work. There was frustration and helplessness when I was solving the problem. 
    </p>
    <h3>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
    <ul class="a">
      <li>
        what was the problem?
      </li>
      <li>
        what problem-solving techniques did you use?
      </li>
      <li>
        how did you feel throughout the process?
      </li>
      <li>
        what did you learn?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The problem was writing the function to capitalize the first letter of every words from a sentence. It was very hard. I did some googling on some concepts, such as split, map, slice etc. I then used console log to use those build-in methods to make sure I knew how to use them to get the result I want. I tried to break the task down so i know what steps to take to get to the end. I did stuck during the whole process. But I went back and googled some videos with instructions to take me through the steps. Then I used console log to test my understanding again. I went back and forth and finally got the result!

    <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
    <ul class="a">
      <li>
        Pseudocode
      </li>
      <li>
        Trying something
      </li>
      <li>
        Rubber ducky method
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading error messages
      </li>
      <li>
        Console.logging
      </li>
      <li>
        Googling
      </li>
      <li>
        Asking your peers for help
      </li>
      <li>
        Asking coaches for help

      <li>
        Improving your process with reflection

      As  my life is very busy with a newborn, a 6 year old and COVID at the moment. My time and energy is very limited, I am trying my best to juggle and be productive. I feel like I did not spend too much time connecting with my peers via discord. But I do really want to reach out and work with my peers! This is something i need to work on in BootCamp. With no coding experiences previously at all, I feel like I already did my best regarding my current situation. I am trying to be kind and show self-compassion to myself while all the self-doubt and mommy guilt came in the way.
