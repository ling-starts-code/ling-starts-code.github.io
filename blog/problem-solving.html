    <h3>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
    <ul class="a">
      <li>
        what was the problem?
      </li>
      <li>
        what problem-solving techniques did you use?
      </li>
      <li>
        how did you feel throughout the process?
      </li>
      <li>
        what did you learn?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The problem was to solve the Super FizzBuzz kata! I could not get my head around the logic. I tried google first but I couldnâ€™t understand the specific part where I was stuck. I read some answers on stackoverflow and watched some youtube videos as well. I felt like I knew some bits and bobs, but i did not know how to put them together and make them work. There was frustration and helplessness when I was solving the problem. 
    </p>
    <h3>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
    <ul class="a">
      <li>
        what was the problem?
      </li>
      <li>
        what problem-solving techniques did you use?
      </li>
      <li>
        how did you feel throughout the process?
      </li>
      <li>
        what did you learn?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The problem was writing the function to capitalize the first letter of every words from a sentence. It was very hard. I did some googling on some concepts, such as split, map, slice etc. I then used console log to use those build-in methods to make sure I knew how to use them to get the result I want. I tried to break the task down so i know what steps to take to get to the end. I did stuck during the whole process. But I went back and googled some videos with instructions to take me through the steps. Then I used console log to test my understanding again. I went back and forth and finally got the result!
    </p>
    <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
    <ul class="a">
      <li>
        Pseudocode
      </li>
      <li>
        Trying something
      </li>
      <li>
        Rubber ducky method
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading error messages
      </li>
      <li>
        Console.logging
      </li>
      <li>
        Googling
      </li>
      <li>
        Asking your peers for help
      </li>
      <li>
        Asking coaches for help
      </li>
      <li>
        Improving your process with reflection
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I am pretty good at googling, reflecting, trying things out and using console.log. My googling skill is definitely improving because I started to know what questions I wanted to ask! I am comfortable with reading error messages and asking coaches for help, too.  I am still learning how to write pseudocode, I am not very confident using it but I know it is a great tool. I just need to learn how to use pseudocode to break my task down and think like a programmer using the basic logic. I also need to work on asking peers for help.
