    <h1>My Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
		<h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
    <p>
			<i> What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</i> 
		</p>
    <p>
      As I am trained as an ECE teacher, I hope to use the skills I gain from this course to make a positive impact on the education system. I would like to build a website for teachers to share their knowledge and connect family whanau and the learning centre. Once I leave Dev Academy, I would like to head into the tech industry and meet like minded people to use these skills to make products that make people’s life easier, especially the minority people. I also would like to use my skills to help the immigrants to settle into New Zealand, connect local kiwis with those immigrants.
    </p>
    <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
      <p>
			I am very good at planning and breaking daunting problems into small and manageable tasks. My limitation is tech knowledge are totally new to me and I found it hard to understand some concepts at first. 
		  </p>
      <P>
      <i>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</i>
      </P>
      <p>
        My biggest strength will still be my ability to learn and adapt. I set the goals and stick to the plan to stay in the course. This has been proved during foundation when my whole family including my 4 weeks old newborn were hit by COVID. My time management skills have saved my life during these hard times. During the foundation learning, I discovered I am pretty good at researching and those skills are still developing. This is very important in learning programming as I will be constantly solving problems. Knowing how to use problem-solving tools is extremely crucial.
      </p>

    <h4>
      What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
    </h4>
      <p><i>While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks, etc.</i> 
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest non-technical challenge  during the Bootcamp it’s going to be how to keep work and life balance so I can be more productive at Bootcamp. Because I have a newborn and a six-year-old boy I need to make sure my life is organised so that I can concentrate on earning learning and be able to engage in learning during Bootcamp. I need to make sure I have a good sleep and exercise so that I might my mind can focus better during the nine weeks. 
      </p>
    <h4>
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?ß
    </h4>
      <p>
      <i>At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and reflective skills.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to develop my communication skills in working remotely with others. I would like to be more connected with my classmates to solve some real problems and learn from each other.
      </p>
    <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
      <p>
      <i>What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is helpful to voice these expectations.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to have regular check-ins from the Bootcamp team. I found it very helpful to just talk to somebody during my foundation learning. I would  like to have those support during Bootcamp. I also would like to have some feedback about how am I doing.
      </p>
    <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h4>
      <p>
      <i>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
       Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
      I would seek help on discord with my classmates and the facilitators when I’m stuck after 15 minutes or so. I already broke down each day’s learning into my calendar. I will have a look at the learning the day before and review my learning at the end of the day. I will also do weekly review and preview to make sure I will stay on course. Communication is the key!!! I need to make sure I communicate in a timely way with  other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. I will let others know my learning situation and reach out for support, also express my gratitude when receive support.

		<h1>My Foundation Learning Plan</h1>
		<h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
    <p>
			My long term goal is to become a front end web developer and have some flexibility of my work. 
		</p>
    <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
      <p>
			I am very good at planning and breaking daunting problems into small and manageable tasks. My limitation is tech knowledge are totally new to me and I found it hard to understand some concepts at first. 
		  </p>
      <P>
      In terms of learning, I am quite good at breaking down big daunting tasks into small, achievable tasks. I also have a good attention span and can focus well. I am also good at planning and time management. I learn things and new concepts pretty fast. However, some times I tend to go too deep when learning new knowledge because there are so many things that I do not know! And then I  might get lost in details on my learning journey. It will be really helpful for me to apply my knowledge to specific project and get a reminder every now and then to remember that’s enough for this stage. 
      </P>
    <h4>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h4>
      <p>I would like to develop my communication skills while studying at Dev Academy, especially regarding remote work communication. Communication is everything when it comes to work with others. I am good at interpersonal communication at my work as a teacher, however, communication in tech industry is quite different as lots of communication happens online. I am not very used to work and communicate online. It could be a little bit overwhelming for me at times. I would like to find a balance for effective communication online. </p>
    <h4>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h4>
      <p>I already broken down my workload into small tasks in my notion notebook,  so the learning process will be more manageable. I would check on discord regularly and ask questions when I’m stuck. I’ll make sure I’ll have some buffer time before the deadline. </p>
      <p>I’ll reflect on my situation and see what are in my control to make changes accordingly. I’ll also actively seeking help and support from my facilitator, classmates, family and friends.  </p>
      <h4>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </h4>
        <p>I’ll first talk to my whānau if my life need some help as a mother of two. I am also learning how to use discord to reach out my facilitator to get in time and effective help. This will save me tons of time and also save me from drowning in the frustration.  </p>
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h4>
        <p>I would like the facilitation team to give me constructive feedback about how can I improve. I also would like to get help in time from the facilitation team, not only just the solution but also the thinking process. How can I solve the same kind of problem next time?  </p>
      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
        <p>I need to look after my newborn and spend some time with my 6 year old after school. My study time depending a lot on my whānau support and my baby’s schedule. I planned to work about a week ahead to prepare any unexpected situations.  </p>
