		<h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
		<h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
    <p>
			My long term goal is to become a front end web developer and have some flexibility of my work. 
		</p>
    <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
      <p>
			I am very good at planning and breaking daunting problems into small and manageable tasks. My limitation is tech knowledge are totally new to me and I found it hard to understand some concepts at first. 
		  </p>
      <P>
      In terms of learning, I am quite good at breaking down big daunting tasks into small, achievable tasks. I also have a good attention span and can focus well. I am also good at planning and time management. I learn things and new concepts pretty fast. However, some times I tend to go too deep when learning new knowledge because there are so many things that I do not know! And then I  might get lost in details on my learning journey. It will be really helpful for me to apply my knowledge to specific project and get a reminder every now and then to remember that’s enough for this stage. 
      </P>
    <h4>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h4>
      <p>I would like to develop my communication skills while studying at Dev Academy, especially regarding remote work communication. Communication is everything when it comes to work with others. I am good at interpersonal communication at my work as a teacher, however, communication in tech industry is quite different as lots of communication happens online. I am not very used to work and communicate online. It could be a little bit overwhelming for me at times. I would like to find a balance for effective communication online. </p>
    <h4>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h4>
      <p>I already broken down my workload into small tasks in my notion notebook,  so the learning process will be more manageable. I would check on discord regularly and ask questions when I’m stuck. I’ll make sure I’ll have some buffer time before the deadline. </p>
      <p>I’ll reflect on my situation and see what are in my control to make changes accordingly. I’ll also actively seeking help and support from my facilitator, classmates, family and friends.  </p>
      <h4>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </h4>
        <p>I’ll first talk to my whānau if my life need some help as a mother of two. I am also learning how to use discord to reach out my facilitator to get in time and effective help. This will save me tons of time and also save me from drowning in the frustration.  </p>
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h4>
        <p>I would like the facilitation team to give me constructive feedback about how can I improve. I also would like to get help in time from the facilitation team, not only just the solution but also the thinking process. How can I solve the same kind of problem next time?  </p>
      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
        <p>I need to look after my newborn and spend some time with my 6 year old after school. My study time depending a lot on my whānau support and my baby’s schedule. I planned to work about a week ahead to prepare any unexpected situations.  </p>
